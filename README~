1. Introduction

RW web application is deployed on the Google App Engine service, hoperfully free 
quotas will be enough for first time. App engine limits access to some classes in
the Java standard library, most notably to those concerning threading and disk 
system support so many jars might not work without some adaptation. Please note
that project structure and code are somtimes might seem really crappy, I'm sorry 
for that.

2. Installing

The tarball contains only webapp source and configuration files. To build it for
local use you need a particular software installed on your computer, luckily all
of that are open source:

     Linux 2.6.x - any modern linux distribution, preferably with good repository
                   system, Mac OS X might work as well, but it wasn't tested. 
                   Windows users enjoy lack of a convinient shell on their systems,
                   but they still can hack it manually. Some GNU utilities like
                   wget and unzip are used extensively in the build script. 

     Sun JDK (OpenJDK) 1.5 - 1.5 is minimal, it's better to use 1.6 though. JDK is needed
                   to build Java source files and run app engine that is mostly 
                   written in java.

     Apache Ant  - can't tell the exact version that will work, I used 1.7.1 though.   

To run the build script type "sh build.sh" in your console. It will download App Engine
and some libraries into cache/ directory and run build/build.xml using Apache Ant.

3. Running

Running the webapp is very straightforward, just "cd build" and type "ant runserver", 
it will run the server to listen 8888 port by default. You may edit build.xml to 
change it. Accessing the webpages via browser first time will trigger Jasper jsp
analyzer to compile jsps into java classes - it may take some time.
